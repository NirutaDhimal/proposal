# Abstract 

The project entitled “Classified Advertising platform (SastoSaaman)” is a website for buying and selling items. Classified advertising is a form of advertising, particularly common in newspapers, online and other periodicals, which may be sold or distributed free of charge. Classified advertisements are much cheaper than larger display advertisements used by businesses. SastoSaaman is a free classifieds and online marketplace that helps users to sell, buy or discover anything across Nepal. This project is the combination of Online market place and Online Classified Advertising platform.Community members can come to our site to sell their old car, bike, music system, laptop or furniture,buy any item that they might want or have to offer and make new friends while doing all of the above.
